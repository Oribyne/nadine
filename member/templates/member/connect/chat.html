<h3>{% blocktrans %}What is freenode?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
<p>{% blocktrans %}From their <a href="http://freenode.net/faq.shtml">FAQ</a>:  <a href="http://freenode.net">Freenode</a> is a special-purpose, not a general-purpose, discussion network, currently implemented on Internet Relay Chat (IRC). It exists to support specific communities. It provides an interactive environment for coordination and support of peer-directed projects, including those relating to free software and open source. Our aim is to help our participants to improve their communicative and collaborative skills and to maintain a friendly, efficient environment for project coordination and technical support. For more information about the network philosophy,
please take a look <a href="http://freenode.net/philosophy.shtml">here</a>.{% endblocktrans %}

<h3>{% blocktrans %}What's with the Captcha?!?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
<p>{% blocktrans %}Since we use <a href="http://freenode.net">freenode</a>, which is a public chat service, they do now allow autoconnect
so that bad people can't abuse the system.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
